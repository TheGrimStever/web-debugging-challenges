Honestly, I thought I was faster at this.  These are the bugs I did find:

The CDN that loaded Angular didn't have a closing Script tag.  I've done this
alot before.  I noticed the color was wrong on my key tags

productsCtrl.js, line 9. --  Debug console was not expecting a ')'.  Looking at
the file, I started matching opening and closing parentheses and brackets, and
found a missing closing bracket.


When injecting UI Router into the angular app, in the brackets, it must be
spelled 'ui.router', not 'ui-router'.  I've done this once before and was stuck
on it for a long time.

In app.js, the .state defining the settings, controller must be named the same
as the module the instantiates it.  This bug had 'settingsctrl' instead of
'settingsCtrl'.

In productsCtrl.js, in looking over the code, I noticed that it was calling a
method in productService, but it was not injected into the controller.
